This was the start of the my coding boot camp. I was extremely enjoyablew _but_ highly intensive. 

Went through the follow criteria:

## Things We worked on

* Journaling 
* Git projects
* Markdown
* Indentation and spacing 
* HTML Block Elments 
* Repositories

## Other intresting stuff
Worked with two new classmates Michael Watts & Tyson Lackey. Good intensive work load but we pulled through as a team. 

We also made Github accounts for our future \*portfolios\*
